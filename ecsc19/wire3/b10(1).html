ode also allows you to port Nmap (which includes Ncat) to new platforms, fix bugs, and
       add new features. You are highly encouraged to send your changes to <dev@nmap.org> for possible
       incorporation into the main distribution. By sending these changes to Fyodor or one of the
       Insecure.Org development mailing lists, it is assumed that you are offering the Nmap Project
       (Insecure.Com LLC) the unlimited, non-exclusive right to reuse, modify, and relicense the code.
       Nmap will always be available open source, but this is important because the inability to
       relicense code has caused devastating problems for other Free Software projects (such as KDE and
       NASM). We also occasionally relicense the code to third parties as discussed in the Nmap man
       page. If you wish to specify special license conditions of your contributions, just say so when
       you send them.

   Inappropriate Usage
       Ncat should never be installed with special privileges (e.g. suid root).  That would open up a
       major security vulnerability as other users on the system (or attackers) could use it for
       privilege escalation.

   Third-Party Software
       This product includes software developed by the Apache Software Foundation[2]. A modified
       version of the Libpcap portable packet capture library[3] is distributed along with Ncat. The
       Windows version of Ncat utilized the Libpcap-derived Npcap library[4] instead. Certain raw
       networking functions use the Libdnet[5] networking library, which was written by Dug Song.  A
       modified version is distributed with Ncat. Ncat can optionally link with the OpenSSL
       cryptography toolkit[6] for SSL version detection support. All of the third-party software
       described in this paragraph is freely redistributable under BSD-style software licenses.
