e
           application and responses sent back to the remote client over the socket, thus making your
           command-line application interactive over a socket. Combined with --keep-open, Ncat will
           handle multiple simultaneous connections to your specified port/application like inetd. Ncat
           will only accept a maximum, definable, number of simultaneous connections controlled by the
           -m option. By default this is set to 100 (60 on Windows).

       -c command, --sh-exec command (Execute command via sh)
           Same as -e, except it tries to execute the command via /bin/sh. This means you don't have to
           specify the full path for the command, and shell facilities like environment variables are
           available.

       --lua-exec file (Execute a .lua script)
           Runs the specified file as a Lua script after a connection has been established, using a
           built-in interpreter. Both the script's standard input and the standard output are
           redirected to the connection data streams.

       All exec options add the following variables to the child's environment:

       NCAT_REMOTE_ADDR, NCAT_REMOTE_PORT
           The IP address and port number of the remote host. In connect mode, it's the target's
           address; in listen mode, it's the client's address.

       NCAT_LOCAL_ADDR, NCAT_LOCAL_PORT
           The IP address and port number of the local end of the connection.

       NCAT_PROTO
           The protocol in use: one of TCP, UDP, and SCTP.

ACCESS CONTROL OPTIONS
       --allow host[,host,...] (Allow connections)
           The list of hosts specified will be the only hosts allowed to connect to the Ncat process.
           All other connection attempts will be disconnected. In case of a conflict between --allow
           and --deny, --allow takes precedence. Host specifications follow the same syntax used by
           Nmap.

       --allowfile file (Allow connections from file)
           This has the same functionality as --allow, except that the allowed hosts are provided in a
           new-line delimited allow file, rather than directly on the command line.

       --deny host[,host,...] (Deny connections)
           Issue Ncat with a list of hosts that will not be allowed to connect to the listening Ncat
           process. Specified hosts will have their session silently terminated if they try to connect.
           In case of a conflict between --allow and --deny, --allow takes precedence. Host
           specifications follow the same syntax used by Nmap.

       --denyfile file (Deny connections from file)
           This is the same functionality as --deny, except that excluded hosts are provided in a
           new-line delimited deny file, rather than direct
