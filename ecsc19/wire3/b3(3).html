ostname and port control the address the server will bind to. Both arguments
       are optional in listen mode. If hostname is omitted, it defaults to listening on all available
       addresses over IPv4 and IPv6. If port is omitted, it defaults to 31337.

PROTOCOL OPTIONS
       -4 (IPv4 only)
           Force the use of IPv4 only.

       -6 (IPv6 only)
           Force the use of IPv6 only.

       -U, --unixsock (Use Unix domain sockets)
           Use Unix domain sockets rather than network sockets. This option may be used on its own for
           stream sockets, or combined with --udp for datagram sockets. A description of -U mode is in
           the section called “UNIX DOMAIN SOCKETS”.

       -u, --udp (Use UDP)
           Use UDP for the connection (the default is TCP).

       --sctp (Use SCTP)
           Use SCTP for the connection (the default is TCP). SCTP support is implemented in
           TCP-compatible mode.

CONNECT MODE OPTIONS
       -g hop1[,hop2,...] (Loose source routing)
           Sets hops for IPv4 loose source routing. You can use -g once with a comma-separated list of
           hops, use -g multiple times with single hops to build the list, or combine the two. Hops can
           be given as IP addresses or hostnames.

       -G ptr (Set source routing pointer)
           Sets the IPv4 source route “pointer” for use with -g. The argument must be a multiple of 4
           and no more than 28. Not all operating systems support setting this pointer to anything
           other than four.

       -p port, --source-port port (Specify source port)
           Set the port number for Ncat to bind to.

       -s host, --source host (Specify source address)
           Set the address for Ncat to bind to.

LISTEN MODE OPTIONS
       See the section called “ACCESS CONTROL OPTIONS” for information on limiting the hosts that may
       connect to the listening Ncat process.

       -l, --listen (Listen for connections)
           Listen for connections rather than connecting to a remote machine

       -m numconns, --max-conns numconns (Specify maximum number of connections)
           The maximum number of simultaneous connections accepted by an Ncat instance. 100 is the
           default (60 on Windows).

       -k, --keep-open (Accept multiple connections)
           Normally a listening server accepts only one connection and then quits when the connection
           is closed. This option makes it accept multiple simultaneous connections and wait for more
           connections after they have all been closed. It must be combined with --listen. In this mode
           there is no way for Ncat to know when its network input is finished, so it will keep running
           until interrupted. This also means that it will
