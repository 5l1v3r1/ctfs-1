BUGS
       Like its authors, Ncat isn't perfect. But you can help make it better by sending bug reports or
       even writing patches. If Ncat doesn't behave the way you expect, first upgrade to the latest
       version available from https://nmap.org. If the problem persists, do some research to determine
       whether it has already been discovered and addressed. Try Googling the error message or browsing
       the nmap-dev archives at http://seclists.org/.

       Read this full manual page as well. If nothing comes of this, mail a bug report to
       <dev@nmap.org>. Please include everything you have learned about the problem, as well as what
       version of Ncat you are running and what operating system version it is running on. Problem
       reports and Ncat usage questions sent to dev@nmap.org are far more likely to be answered than
       those sent to Fyodor directly.

       Code patches to fix bugs are even better than bug reports. Basic instructions for creating patch
       files with your changes are available at https://svn.nmap.org/nmap/HACKING. Patches may be sent
       to nmap-dev (recommended) or to Fyodor directly.

       The original Netcat was written by *Hobbit* <hobbit@avian.org>. While Ncat isn't built on any
       code from the ‚Äútraditional‚Äù Netcat (or any other implementation), Ncat is most definitely based
       on Netcat in spirit and functionality.
