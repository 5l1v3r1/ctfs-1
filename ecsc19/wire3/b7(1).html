ly on the command line.

TIMING OPTIONS
       These options accept a time parameter. This is specified in seconds by default, though you can
       append ms, s, m, or h to the value to specify milliseconds, seconds, minutes, or hours.

       -d time, --delay time (Specify line delay)
           Set the delay interval for lines sent. This effectively limits the number of lines that Ncat
           will send in the specified period. This may be useful for low-bandwidth sites, or have other
           uses such as coping with annoying iptables --limit options.

       -i time, --idle-timeout time (Specify idle timeout)
           Set a fixed timeout for idle connections. If the idle timeout is reached, the connection is
           terminated.

       -w time, --wait time (Specify connect timeout)
           Set a fixed timeout for connection attempts.

OUTPUT OPTIONS
       -o file, --output file (Save session data)
           Dump session data to a file

       -x file, --hex-dump file (Save session data in hex)
           Dump session data in hex to a file.

       --append-output (Append output)
           Issue Ncat with --append-ouput along with -o and/or -x and it will append the resulted
           output rather than truncating the specified output files.

       -v, --verbose (Be verbose)
           Issue Ncat with -v and it will be verbose and display all kinds of useful connection based
           information. Use more than once (-vv, -vvv...) for greater verbosity.

MISC OPTIONS
       -C, --crlf (Use CRLF as EOL)
           This option tells Ncat to convert LF line endings to CRLF when taking input from standard
           input.  This is useful for talking to some stringent servers directly from a terminal in one
           of the many common plain-text protocols that use CRLF for end-of-line.

       -h, --help (Help screen)
           Displays a short help screen with common options and parameters, and then exits.

       --recv-only (Only receive data)
           If this option is passed, Ncat will only receive data and will not try to send anything.

       --send-only (Only send data)
           If this option is passed, then Ncat will only send data and will ignore anything received.
           This option also causes Ncat to close the network connection and terminate after EOF is
           received on standard input.

       --no-shutdown (Do not shutdown into half-duplex mode)
           If this option is passed, Ncat will not invoke shutdown on a socket aftering seeing EOF on
           stdin. This is provided for backward-compatibility with OpenBSD netcat, which exhibits this
           behavior when executed with its '-d' option.

       -t, --telnet (Answer Telnet negotiations)
           Handle DO/DONT WILL/WONT Telnet negotiati
