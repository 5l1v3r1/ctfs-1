 never close its output stream, so any
           program reading from Ncat and looking for end-of-file will also hang.

       --broker (Connection brokering)
           Allow multiple parties to connect to a centralised Ncat server and communicate with each
           other. Ncat can broker communication between systems that are behind a NAT or otherwise
           unable to directly connect. This option is used in conjunction with --listen, which causes
           the --listen port to have broker mode enabled.

       --chat (Ad-hoc “chat server”)
           The --chat option enables chat mode, intended for the exchange of text between several
           users. In chat mode, connection brokering is turned on. Ncat prefixes each message received
           with an ID before relaying it to the other connections. The ID is unique for each connected
           client. This helps distinguish who sent what. Additionally, non-printing characters such as
           control characters are escaped to keep them from doing damage to a terminal.

SSL OPTIONS
       --ssl (Use SSL)
           In connect mode, this option transparently negotiates an SSL session with an SSL server to
           securely encrypt the connection. This is particularly handy for talking to SSL enabled HTTP
           servers, etc.

           In server mode, this option listens for incoming SSL connections, rather than plain
           untunneled traffic.

           In UDP connect mode, this option enables Datagram TLS (DTLS). This is not supported in
           server mode.

       --ssl-verify (Verify server certificates)
           In client mode, --ssl-verify is like --ssl except that it also requires verification of the
           server certificate. Ncat comes with a default set of trusted certificates in the file
           ca-bundle.crt.  Some operating systems provide a default list of trusted certificates; these
           will also be used if available. Use --ssl-trustfile to give a custom list. Use -v one or
           more times to get details about verification failures.  Ncat does not check for revoked
           certificates.

           This option has no effect in server mode.

       --ssl-cert certfile.pem (Specify SSL certificate)
           This option gives the location of a PEM-encoded certificate files used to authenticate the
           server (in listen mode) or the client (in connect mode). Use it in combination with
           --ssl-key.

       --ssl-key keyfile.pem (Specify SSL private key)
           This option gives the location of the PEM-encoded private key file that goes with the
           certificate named with --ssl-cert.

       --ssl-trustfile cert.pem (List trusted certificates)
           This option sets a list of certificates that are trus
