NCAT(1)                                   Ncat Reference Guide                                  NCAT(1)

NAME
       ncat - Concatenate and redirect sockets

SYNOPSIS
       ncat [OPTIONS...] [hostname] [port]

DESCRIPTION
       Ncat is a feature-packed networking utility which reads and writes data across networks from the
       command line. Ncat was written for the Nmap Project and is the culmination of the currently
       splintered family of Netcat incarnations. It is designed to be a reliable back-end tool to
       instantly provide network connectivity to other applications and users. Ncat will not only work
       with IPv4 and IPv6 but provides the user with a virtually limitless number of potential uses.

       Among Ncat's vast number of features there is the ability to chain Ncats together; redirection
       of TCP, UDP, and SCTP ports to other sites; SSL support; and proxy connections via SOCKS4,
       SOCKS5 or HTTP proxies (with optional proxy authentication as well). Some general principles
       apply to most applications and thus give you the capability of instantly adding networking
       support to software that would normally never support it.
