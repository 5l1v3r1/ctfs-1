ted for purposes of certificate
           verification. It has no effect unless combined with --ssl-verify. The argument to this
           option is the name of a PEM file containing trusted certificates. Typically, the file will
           contain certificates of certification authorities, though it may also contain server
           certificates directly. When this option is used, Ncat does not use its default certificates.

       --ssl-ciphers cipherlist (Specify SSL ciphersuites)
           This option sets the list of ciphersuites that Ncat will use when connecting to servers or
           when accepting SSL connections from clients. The syntax is described in the OpenSSL
           ciphers(1) man page, and defaults to ALL:!aNULL:!eNULL:!LOW:!EXP:!RC4:!MD5:@STRENGTH

       --ssl-alpn ALPN list (Specify ALPN protocol list)
           This option allows you to specify a comma-separated list of protocols to send via the
           Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) TLS extension. Not supported by all versions
           of OpenSSL.

PROXY OPTIONS
       --proxy host[:port] (Specify proxy address)
           Requests proxying through host:port, using the protocol specified by --proxy-type.

           If no port is specified, the proxy protocol's well-known port is used (1080 for SOCKS and
           3128 for HTTP). However, when specifying an IPv6 HTTP proxy server using the IP address
           rather than the hostname, the port number MUST be specified as well. If the proxy requires
           authentication, use --proxy-auth.

       --proxy-type proto (Specify proxy protocol)
           In connect mode, this option requests the protocol proto to connect through the proxy host
           specified by --proxy. In listen mode, this option has Ncat act as a proxy server using the
           specified protocol.

           The currently available protocols in connect mode are http (CONNECT), socks4 (SOCKSv4), and
           socks5 (SOCKSv5). The only server currently supported is http. If this option is not used,
           the default protocol is http.

       --proxy-auth user[:pass] (Specify proxy credentials)
           In connect mode, gives the credentials that will be used to connect to the proxy server. In
           listen mode, gives the credentials that will be required of connecting clients. For use with
           --proxy-type http or --proxy-type socks5, the form should be username:password. For
           --proxy-type socks4, it should be a username only.

COMMAND EXECUTION OPTIONS
       -e command, --exec command (Execute command)
           Execute the specified command after a connection has been established. The command must be
           specified as a full pathname. All input from the remote client will be sent to th
